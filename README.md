# UFO sightings

## Overview of Project
    Providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

### Purpose
    Allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 


## Results
   After adding the filters, you have the ability to filter the data
   using five different criteria to get more detailed data.
   you can use the date, city, state, county and shape filters to get data for 
   certain criteria or you can have a combination of multiple criteria at the same time.


## Summary

### one of the drawbacks of this design.
    . This design does not have "in between date" filter.

### two recommendations for further development.
    . Adding "in between date" filter.
    . Adding a "sort" function in the data table.
